# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  bio    : "I’m a software developer with an academic background in computional physicsist, 
            passionate about solving complex problems at the intersection of technology and 
            the physical world. My journey has included self-driven projects in C++ and Qt/QML—especially 
            in interactive and simulation-based applications. Though I’m at the beginning of my 
            professional career, I bring strong analytical thinking from physics, coding skills 
            from computer science, and a continuous drive to learn and contribute to innovative, high-tech solutions."
