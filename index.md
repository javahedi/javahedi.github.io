My journey has included self-driven projects in C++ and Qt/QMLâ€”especially in interactive and simulation-based applications. Though Iâ€™m at the beginning of my professional career, I bring strong analytical thinking from physics, coding skills from computer science, and a continuous drive to learn and contribute to innovative, high-tech solutions.

# Simulation & Qt/C++ Projects

A collection of my self-driven projects that combine my interests in physics, computer science, and simulation.

## ðŸ§ª Physics-Inspired Simulations

### ðŸ”¸ Particle Simulator (C++/Qt/QML)
- **Description:** A simple 2D particle system simulating gravitational interactions.
- **Technologies:** C++, Qt/QML
- **Features:**
  - Interactive UI with QML
  - Adjustable physical parameters (mass, velocity, etc.)
  - Real-time visual feedback

### ðŸ”¸ Wave Interference Visualizer (Python)
- **Description:** Simulates wave interference patterns (e.g., double-slit experiment).
- **Technologies:** Python, Matplotlib, NumPy
- **Features:**
  - Adjustable wavelength, slit separation
  - Visualizes intensity distribution in real time

## ðŸŽ® Interactive & Game-like Projects

### ðŸ”¸ Qt Game Engine Prototype
- **Description:** A minimal 2D game engine using QML and C++ backend.
- **Technologies:** Qt/QML, C++
- **Features:**
  - Entity-based design
  - QML-based UI and scene control
  - C++ logic for physics and interactions

### ðŸ”¸ QML/Java Game UI Mockups
- **Description:** Designed and implemented mock UI for a strategy game.
- **Technologies:** QML, Java (logic layer)
- **Features:**
  - Responsive layout
  - State-based transitions
  - Touch and keyboard interaction
