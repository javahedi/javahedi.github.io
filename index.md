My journey has included self-driven projects in C++ and Qt/QMLâ€”especially in interactive and simulation-based applications. Though Iâ€™m at the beginning of my professional career, I bring strong analytical thinking from physics, coding skills from computer science, and a continuous drive to learn and contribute to innovative, high-tech solutions.

# Simulation & Qt/C++ Projects

A collection of my self-driven projects that combine my interests in physics, computer science, and simulation.

## ðŸ§ª Physics-Inspired Simulations
